This is my final project.
readData.py reads data from csv files and does the data cleasning
corona_tests.english.csv is the data for infection
Cleaned-Data.csv is the data for severity

run the code with switching the fitness function used
(Highlighted with TODO comments)

evaluation.py requires import external models

The structure is the same as previous assignmnets,
Hope this makes everything easier : D
